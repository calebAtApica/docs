# Deploying LOGIQ PaaS on MicroK8s

[MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) is a lightweight, pure-upstream Kubernetes aiming to reduce entry barriers for K8s and cloud-native application development. It comes in a single package that installs a single-node \(standalone\) K8s cluster in under 60 seconds. The lightweight nature of LOGIQ PaaS enables you to deploy LOGIQ on lightweight, single-node clusters like MicroK8s.

The following guide takes you through deploying LOGIQ PaaS on MicroK8s.

## Installing MicroK8s

The first step in this deployment is to install MicroK8s on your machine. To install MicroK8s, do the following.

1. Update package lists by running the following command.

   ```text
   sudo apt-get -y update
   ```

2. Install `core` using Snap by running the following command.

   ```text
   sudo snap install core
   ```

3. Install MicroK8s using Snap by running the following command.

   ```text
   sudo snap install microk8s --classic
   ```

4. Join the group created by MicroK8s that enables uninterrupted usage of commands that require admin access by running the following command.

   ```text
   sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER
   ```

5. Add your current user to the group to gain access to the `.kube` caching directory by running the following command.

   ```text
   sudo chown -f -R $USER ~/.kube
   ```

6. Generate your MicroK8s configuration and merge it with your Kubernetes configuration by running the following command.

   ```text
   sudo microk8s config > ~/.kube/config
   ```

7. Check whether MicroK8s is up and running with the following command.

   ```text
   sudo microk8s status
   ```

MicroK8s is now installed on your machine.

## Enabling add-ons

Now that we have MicroK8s up and running, letâ€™s set up your cluster and enable the add-ons necessary such as Helm, CoreDNS, ingress, storage, and private registry. MicroK8s readily provides these addons and can be enabled and disabled at any time. Most of these add-ons are pre-configured to work without any additional setup.

To enable add-ons on your MicroK8s cluster, run the following commands in succession.

1. Enable Helm 3.

   ```text
   microk8s enable helm3
   ```

2. Enable a default storage class that allocates storage from a host directory.

   ```text
   microk8s enable storage
   ```

3. Enable CoreDNS.

   ```text
   microk8s enable dns
   ```

4. Enable ingress.

   ```text
   microk8s enable ingress
   ```

   To enable https on your cluster, create a secret with your keys and pass the secret with ingress.

   ```text
   microk8s enable ingress:default-ssl-certificate=namespace/secret_name
   ```

5. Enable private registry.

   ```text
   microk8s enable registry
   ```

6. Copy over your MicroK8s configuration to your Kubernetes configuration with the following command.

   ```text
   microk8s.kubectl config view > $HOME/.kube/config
   ```

## Provisioning an IP address

In this step, we'll provision an endpoint or an IP address where we access LOGIQ PaaS after deploying it on MicroK8s. You can skip this step if its your local implementation. For this, we'll leverage [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf) which is a load-balancer implementation that uses standard routing protocols for bare metal Kubernetes clusters.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Since MetalLB is available as an add-on for MicroK8s, you can also run these steps while enabling add-ons for your MicroK8s cluster.
{% endhint %}

To provision an IP address, do the following:

1. Check your local machine's IP address by running the `ifconfig` command, as shown below.

   ```text
    ifconfig:
    wlp60s0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
    inet 192.168.1.27 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255
   ```

2. Enable MetalLB by running the following command.

   ```text
    microk8s enable metallb
    Enabling MetalLB
    Enter each IP address range delimited by comma (e.g.     '10.64.140.43-10.64.140.49,192.168.0.105-192.168.0.111'): 192.168.1.27-192.168.1.27
   ```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** MetalLB will not work on macOS due to network filtering that macOS applies. MetalLB might not work if you're provisioning an EC2 instance on AWS due to your private/public IP configuration.
{% endhint %}

## Installing LOGIQ PaaS

Now that your MicroK8s environment is configured and ready, we can proceed with installing LOGIQ PaaS on it. To install LOGIQ PaaS using Helm, do the following:

1. Add the LOGIQ PaaS Helm chart to your Helm repository by running the following command.

   ```text
   helm repo add logiq-repo https://logiqai.github.io/helm-charts
   ```

2. Update your Helm repository by running the following command.

   ```text
   helm repo update
   ```

3. Create a namespace on MicroK8s on which to install LOGIQ PaaS.

   ```text
   microk8s kubectl create namespace logiq
   ```

4. Install LOGIQ PaaS using Helm with the storage class set to `microk8s-hostpath` with the following command.

   ```text
   helm install logiq -n logiq --set global.persistence.storageClass=microk8s-hostpath logiq-repo/logiq -f     values.microk8s.yaml  --debug --timeout 10m
   ```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You can use the [starter `values.yaml`](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LmzGprckLqwd5v6bs6m%2F-MQ3BQwto2mGZmAgEveP%2F-MQ3BXv1S-DqlVCWRpOw%2Fvalues.large.yaml?alt=media&token=7d4772bf-39e0-4030-8620-1de1a64aed99) file we've created to configure your LOGIQ PaaS deployment. You can modify the values listed in the `values.yaml` file to suit your needs.
{% endhint %}

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/values.microk8s.yaml" caption="Starter values.microk8s.yaml file" %}

LOGIQ PaaS is now installed in your MicroK8s environment.

## Accessing LOGIQ PaaS

Now that LOGIQ PaaS is installed on your MicroK8s cluster, you can visit the LOGIQ PaaS UI by accessing the MetalLB endpoint we defined in the pre-install steps. To access the LOGIQ PaaS UI, do the following:

1. Inspect the pods in your MicroK8s cluster in the `logiq` namespace by running the following command.

   ```text
   microk8s kubectl get pod -n logiq
   ```

2. Find the exact MetalLB endpoint that's serving the LOGIQ PaaS UI by running the following command.

   ```text
   microk8s kubectl get service -n logiq |grep -i loadbalancer
   ```

   The above command should give you an output similar to the following.

   ```text
   logiq-kubernetes-ingress  LoadBalancer   10.152.183.45  192.168.1.27

   80:30537/TCP,20514:30222/TCP,24224:30909/TCP,24225:31991/TCP,2514:30800/TCP,3000:32680/TCP,514:32450/    TCP,7514:30267/TCP,8081:30984/TCP,9998:31425/TCP     18m
   ```

3. Using a web browser of your choice, access the IP address shown by the load balancer service above. For example, `http://192.168.1.27:80`.

Your LOGIQ PaaS UI is now available in your web browser. You can log into LOGIQ PaaS using the following default credentials.

* **Username**: `flash-admin@foo.com`
* **Password**: `flash-password`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You can change the default login credentials after you've logged into the UI.
{% endhint %}
