# Quickstart guide

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please read and agree with the [EULA](https://docs.logiq.ai/eula/eula) before proceeding.
{% endhint %}

## Install Docker compose

You can spin-up LOGIQ using `docker-compose`. Install guide for `docker-compose` can be found here - [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

{% hint style="info" %}
_**NOTE:** the docker-compose quick-start YAML files are intended for demo and trial use only. If you want to run a production deployment, we recommend you use Kubernetes with HELM to deploy the LOGIQ stack. Please contact us at : s a l e s @ l o g i q . a i_
{% endhint %}

## Running LOGIQ

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: LOGIQ services use approximately 2GB of memory. Please have sufficient memory in your system before proceeding
{% endhint %}

The first step is to get the appropriate `docker-compose` YAML file from the URL below.

â¬‡ Download the YAML here - [https://logiqcf.s3.amazonaws.com/2.0.1/docker-compose.quickstart.yml](https://logiqcf.s3.amazonaws.com/2.0.1/docker-compose.quickstart.yml)

You are now ready to bring up the LOGIQ stack.

```text
$docker-compose -f docker-compose.quickstart.yml up -d
```
{% hint style="info" %}
_**NOTE:** If you have been running previous versions of LOGIQ docker-compose, you should stop and remove the existing containers by running docker-compose -f docker-compose.quickstart.yml down and removing any older docker volume via docker-compose -f docker-compose.quickstart.yml rm && docker-compose -f docker-compose.quickstart.yml rm -v
{% endhint %}

## Test using LOGIQ UI

Once the LOGIQ server is up and running, the LOGIQ UI can be accessed as described above on port 80 on the server docker-compose. You will be presented with a login screen as shown below.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use _flash-admin@foo.com_ / _flash-password_ to login
{% endhint %}

### Prometheus monitoring and alerting

The LOGIQ quickstart file includes Prometheus and Alertmanager services and a built-in monitoring dashboard for LOGIQ.
