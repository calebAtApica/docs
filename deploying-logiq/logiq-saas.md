# LOGIQ SaaS

LOGIQ SaaS enables you to converge all of your IT data from disparate sources, manage your logs, and monitor, analyse, and troubleshoot your IT environment in real-time at infinite scale - without the need to manage or scale the underlying infrastructure or storage.&#x20;

## Signing up for LOGIQ SaaS

If you haven't signed up for LOGIQ SaaS, do the following.

2. Provide your **Name** and business **Email Address**.&#x20;
3. Select a Business or Enterprise plan that suits your need. \
   \
   **Note:** Regardless of the plan you select, you'd still get access to a 14-day free trial of the plan you select. Post the free trial period, if you choose not to purchase a plan, you'd still have access to the data you ingested for a period of one week. \

5. Click **Register**.&#x20;
6. Provide your payment information and click **Subscribe**. \

   **Note:** Your payment method will not be charged until the end of the 14-day trial period. You can cancel your subscription at any point during the trial period. We'll also check in with you to see if you'd like to proceed with the payment before the trial ends.&#x20;

This completes the sign up process. We'll send your LOGIQ account credentials to your registered email shortly after you sign up.&#x20;
