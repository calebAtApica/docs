# SNMP

The devices that are connecting to the internet are increasing drastically. The data produced by switches, routers, and other IoT devices is huge and it can provide valuable information that will be used for monitoring all the devices connected. Those data can be fetched or managed by SNMP protocol which will be running as a service in your device.

Apica Ascent platform provides a source extension plugin for SNMP that will help you collect data from all your SNMP agents.



### Steps to Create SNMP Extension

* Provide the credentials for accessing the SNMP agents
* Provide a custom MIB filename and load the MIB file, if you want to use a custom OID
* Add OID and the corresponding name for the OID which will be used as the attribute name of the data when we ingest it to the Apica ascent platform.\
