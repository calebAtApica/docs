# Rules

LOGIQ provides a set of Data Management Rules that help you manage your data. These rules are packaged into Rule Packs and are available on the Rules page.

Here are some of the Data Management Rules that LOGIQ supports:

* [Filter Rules](https://docs.logiq.ai/data-management/filter)
* [Extract Rules](https://docs.logiq.ai/data-management/extract)
* [SIEM Rules](https://docs.logiq.ai/data-management/siem-and-tag)
* [TAG Rules](https://docs.logiq.ai/data-management/siem-and-tag)
* [Rewrite Rules](https://docs.logiq.ai/data-management/rewrite)
* [Forward Rules](https://docs.logiq.ai/data-management/forward)

To access the inbuilt rules, simply click on the "Rules" menu in the navigation bar. From there, you can browse and manage your Rule Packs, and configure your Data Management Rules to suit your needs.
