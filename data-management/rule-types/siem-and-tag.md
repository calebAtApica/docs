# SIEM and TAG

SIEM and TAG rules are Log2Metric rules that can be used to tag data for any interesting events. LOGIQ Log2Metrics is a powerful feature that helps you convert your log data into a real-time metric. Using Log2Metrics, you can visualize your log data, plot distributions, create a custom index, and create alerts for events.

This is useful for identifying the interesting events that may occur in logs in real-time. For example track, user login failures, track load balancer or ingress status codes, etc... See the section about [Log2Metrics](../../log-management/metrics-and-custom-indices.md) for additional information.&#x20;

LOGIQ has hundreds of inbuilt SIEM rules which can be accessed on the "Rules" page.&#x20;
