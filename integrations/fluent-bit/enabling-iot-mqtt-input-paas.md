# Enabling IoT(MQTT) Input  (PAAS)

MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth. MQTT today is used in a wide variety of industries, such as automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications, oil and gas, etc.

#### Fluent Bit to LOGIQ

The below steps outline on how to create a ConfigMap that will be used by the Fluent Bit Deployment:

```
kubectl create -f fluent-bit-config-logiq-forward.yml
```

Fluent Bit deployment is ready to be used with LOGIQ on a regular Kubernetes Cluster, configure the following in deployment `fluent-bit-ddeployment.yml`. If you do not have your ingest token, You can generate them using [`logiqctl`](https://docs.logiq.ai/logiq-server/agentless/generating-secure-ingest-token)

*   name: CLUSTER\_ID

    value: "YOUR\_CLUSTER\_ID"
*   name: LOGIQ\_TOKEN

    value: "YOUR\_INGEST\_TOKEN"

```
kubectl create -f fluent-bit-deployment.yml
```
