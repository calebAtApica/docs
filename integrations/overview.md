# Overview

LOGIQ comes with a number of integration options that lets you connect with and securely ingest data from popular log forwarding agents, cloud services, operating systems, container applications, and on-premise infrastructure. You can secure data ingestion from your endpoints into LOGIQ by [generating a secure ingest token](generating-a-secure-ingest-token.md). &#x20;

LOGIQ currently integrates with the following.&#x20;

* [Logstash](logstash.md)
* [Fluent Bit](fluent-bit/)
* [Fluentd](fluentd.md)
* [Rsyslogd](rsyslogd.md)
* [AWS CloudWatch](aws-cloudwatch-exporter.md)
* [Palo Alto Firewall](palo-alto-firewall.md)
* [Azure Event Hubs](azure-event-hubs.md)
* [Prometheus](prometheus.md)
* [Docker Syslog log driver](docker-syslog-log-driver.md)
* [Elasticsearch](../elasticsearch-data-source.md)
* [JSON endpoints](../json-data-source.md)

You can also ingest logs from endpoint devices running:

* [Windows](fluent-bit/#fluent-bit-for-windows)
* [macOS](https://github.com/logiqai/logiq-installation/tree/main/fluent-bit/macos)
* [Linux](https://github.com/logiqai/logiq-installation/tree/main/fluent-bit/linux)
