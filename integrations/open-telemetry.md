# Open Telemetry

OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help analyze softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.



Prometheus Remote Write Exporter can be leveraged to send OpenTelemetry metrics to Prometheus [remote write compatible backends](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/) and these metrics can be visualized on Logiq&#x20;

```

exporters:
  prometheusremotewrite:
    endpoint: "https://<logiq-endpoint>/api/v1/receive"
    wal: # Enabling the Write-Ahead-Log for the exporter.
      directory: ./prom_rw # The directory to store the WAL in
      buffer_size: 100 # Optional count of elements to be read from the WAL before truncating; default of 300
      truncate_frequency: 45s # Optional frequency for how often the WAL should be truncated. It is a time.ParseDuration; default of 1m
    tls: 
      insecure: "false"
      insecure_skip_verify: "true"
    external_labels: #labels to identify the metric
