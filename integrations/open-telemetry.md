# Open Telemetry

### Overview

OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help analyze softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.

### OpenTelemetry Metrics

Prometheus Remote Write Exporter can be used to send OpenTelemetry metrics to Prometheus [remote write compatible backends](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/)

LOGIQ.AI implements a preometheus remote write backend so metric data from open telementry collectors can be sent to LOGIQ with a simple configuration as described below.

Enable the _prometheusremorewrite_ exporter in your open telemetry configuration yaml

```
exporters:
  prometheusremotewrite:
```

Specify the LOGIQ.AI cluster endpoint to send the remote write data. LOGIQ.AI implements automatic retention tiering to object storage for all your opentelemetry metrics data giving you infinite retention and scale with zero storage overheads as your metrics needs grow.

```
endpoint: "https://<logiq-endpoint>/api/v1/receive"
```

Here's a full configuration example below with TLS enabled.

{% hint style="info" %}
if you are using OpenTelemetry on AWS, remove the "wal:" section below
{% endhint %}

```
exporters:
  prometheusremotewrite:
    endpoint: "https://<logiq-endpoint>/api/v1/receive"
    wal: # Enabling the Write-Ahead-Log for the exporter.
      directory: ./prom_rw # The directory to store the WAL in
      buffer_size: 100 # Optional count of elements to be read from the WAL before truncating; default of 300
      truncate_frequency: 45s # Optional frequency for how often the WAL should be truncated. It is a time.ParseDuration; default of 1m
    tls: 
      ca_file: <file-name>
      cert_file: <file-name>
      key_file: <file-name>

    external_labels: #labels to identify the metric
         label1: value1
