# Azure

**Overview**\
\
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and supports many different programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.

**Integrations** Azure offers a broad spectrum of services that generate observability data through various tools and platforms. Apica Ascent integrates these tools into a unified interface, allowing for streamlined monitoring and management.

See the sub-modules on this page for integrations for Azure enabled by Apica Ascent.
