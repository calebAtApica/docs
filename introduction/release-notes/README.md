*   **Topology-powered root-cause analysis**.

    Visualize your data streams as a topology with drill down to errors and warnings for faster root causes. Helps visualize the health of your applications. Users can quickly investigate the issues by clicking errors or alerts.
*   **Data flow Pipelines**.

    The pipeline is a series of processes or stages through which data flow systematically and efficiently. Helps to visualize the flow between nodes, rules, and filters applied for the data flow. Shows the inflow and outflow information of data, and also helps in identifying the data loss or optimizing the data flow to forward destinations.
*   **Search results aggregates**.

    Buit-in Pivot table makes it easy to analyze large data sets from search queries. Summarize or Visualize a set of data points for instant analysis. Some common examples of aggregation functions include(Count, Value, Sum, Count Unique Values, List Unique Values, Average, Median, Min, Max). Aggregation functions are used to summarize large datasets into a more manageable form for further analysis and visualization. And includes different types of visualizations (Table, Line chart, Area chart, Scatter chart, Dot chart, and Multiple pie chart).
*   **Re-designed Landing page**.

    Instantly get access to valuable insights when you login into our redesigned Explore page. Users now log in and directly land on the Explore page with quick summaries at their fingertips.
