*   **Implementation of **<mark style="color:blue;">**ALIVE**</mark>** ( Autonomous Log Interaction Visual Explorer ) .**&#x20;

    It's an interactive visualisation tool that allows you to pinpoint issues and patterns in your application.It provides an insightful representation of unstructured logs. Key features include:&#x20;

    * Autonomous log analysis&#x20;
    * Interactive visualisation&#x20;
    * Flow representation&#x20;
    * Insightful representation&#x20;
    * Scalability
*   **Improved On boarding Experience by **<mark style="color:blue;">**App Tour**</mark>** .**&#x20;

    With the App Tour users can now enjoy a guided introduction to our platforms'key features, ensuring a smooth and intuitive navigation right from the start .

*   **Enhancement in Search feature by adding **<mark style="color:blue;">**Regex for Extract**</mark>** .**&#x20;

    Get a holistic taxonomy of logs by automatically categorising them based on their content,context and other characterstics. This capability provides users with a way to extract and classify logs automatically,improving the speed and accuracy of log-analysis. This saves time and effort by automating the process of field extraction, eliminating the need for users to manually identify and extract fields .&#x20;
*   <mark style="color:blue;">**Apica**</mark>** Input Plugin.**&#x20;

    The Apica Input plugin is a component designed to integrate with the Apica Synthetics and Load test platform. Its main purpose is to retrieve check results from the Apica platform and make them available for further processing or analysis within another system or tool.
*   **New forwarder for **<mark style="color:blue;">**Corologix**</mark>**.**&#x20;

    By using the forwarder,Users can selectively send specific log data to Coralogix based on their filtering criteria, thereby reducing the amount of data stored and analyzed. This can lead to cost optimization as it allows users to focus their resources on the most relevant and important log data, rather than storing and processing unnecessary or redundant information.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**GCP BigQuery**</mark>** Forwarder (** [**know more ..**](http://localhost:5000/s/8WGNQCWSTnL2NgouIRTq/forwarding-to-data-warehouse/gcp-bigquery)**)**
*   **Topology view **<mark style="color:blue;">**Enhancements**</mark> :sparkles:

    Recent enhancements in the topology view is the inclusion of the total events information. This improvement provides users with a clearer understanding of the overall event activity within the system or network.
* **Various Bug fixes and Improvements .**&#x20;

## v3.5.9.1 <a href="#uversionv359u" id="uversionv359u"></a>

### **ðŸ“… Fri, Mar 24, 2023**

*   **Topology-powered root-cause analysis**.

    Visualize your data streams as a topology with drill down to errors and warnings for faster root causes. Helps visualize the health of your applications. Users can quickly investigate the issues by clicking errors or alerts.
*   **Data flow Pipelines**.

    The pipeline is a series of processes or stages through which data flow systematically and efficiently. Helps to visualize the flow between nodes, rules, and filters applied for the data flow. Shows the inflow and outflow information of data, and also helps in identifying the data loss or optimizing the data flow to forward destinations.
*   **Search results aggregates**.

    Buit-in Pivot table makes it easy to analyze large data sets from search queries. Summarize or Visualize a set of data points for instant analysis. Some common examples of aggregation functions include(Count, Value, Sum, Count Unique Values, List Unique Values, Average, Median, Min, Max). Aggregation functions are used to summarize large datasets into a more manageable form for further analysis and visualization. And includes different types of visualizations (Table, Line chart, Area chart, Scatter chart, Dot chart, and Multiple pie chart).
*   **Re-designed Landing page**.

    Instantly get access to valuable insights when you login into our redesigned Explore page. Users now log in and directly land on the Explore page with quick summaries at their fingertips.

    1. Introduced counter widgets for EPS, Total Flows, Total Events, Forwarders, and Source Extensions.
    2. Added a new Event Statistics column, which has counts of (Errors, Alerts, Critical, Emergency), (Warnings) and (Total) events.
*   **OSSEC HIDS Mappings**

    Automatically map OSSEC HIDS event severity and log messages for Linux and Windows environments.
* **Added support for exporting events and metrics from** [**Apache Beam**](https://docs.logiq.ai/integrations/apache-beam) **to Apica Ascent**.
*   **OpenTelemetry `otel.status_code` Mapping**

    Detect OpenTelemetry severity and level embeddings and map them into severity levels.
* **Memory and performance improvements**.
* **Automated agent installation for Linux and Windows**.
