The following sections in this article describe the various elements of the LOGIQ UI and their purposes.&#x20;

## Dashboards

A dashboard is a collection of visualizations and queries that you've created against your log data. You could create dashboards to house visualizations and queries for specific as well as multiple data sources. Everything contained within a dashboard is updated in real-time.&#x20;

The **Dashboards** page on the LOGIQ UI lists all of the dashboards you've created within LOGIQ. Dashboards that you've favorited are marked with a yellow star icon and are also listed under the **Dashboards** dropdown menu for quick access in the navigation bar. The following images depict dashboards that you can create using LOGIQ.&#x20;

## **Queries**

LOGIQ enables you to write custom queries to analyze log data, display metrics and events, view and customize events and alerts, and create custom dashboards. The **Queries** page lists all of the queries you've created on LOGIQ. You can mark some of them as favorites or archive the ones, not in use. Your favorite queries also appear in the drop-down menu of the **Queries** tab for quick access.

## **Alerts**

LOGIQ enables you to set alerts against events, data, or metrics of interest derived from your log data. The **Alerts** page on the UI lists all of the alerts you've configured on LOGIQ. You can sort and display the list of alerts by their name, message, state, and the time they were last updated or created. Depending on your user permissions within LOGIQ, you can click an alert to view more information or reconfigure the alert based on your need.&#x20;

## Explore

The Explore page lists all of the log streams generated across your IT environment that are being ingested into LOGIQ. The Explore page lists and categorizes logs based on Namespace, Application, ProcID, and when they were last updated. By default, logs are listed by the time they were ingested with the most recent applications appearing on the top. You can filter log streams by namespaces, applications, and ProcIDs. You can also filter them by custom time ranges.&#x20;

You can also click into a specific application or ProcID to view logs in more detail and to search through or identify patterns within your log data.&#x20;
