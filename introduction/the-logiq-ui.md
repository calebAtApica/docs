## **Alerts**

Apica Ascent enables you to set alerts against events, data, or metrics of interest derived from your log data. The **Alerts** page on the UI lists all of the alerts you've configured on Apica Ascent. You can sort and display the list of alerts by their name, message, state, and the time they were last updated or created. Depending on your user permissions within Apica Ascent, you can click an alert to view more information or reconfigure the alert based on your need.&#x20;

## Explore

The Explore page lists all of the log streams generated across your IT environment that are being ingested into Apica Ascent. The Explore page lists and categorizes logs based on Namespace, Application, ProcID, and when they were last updated. By default, logs are listed by the time they were ingested with the most recent applications appearing on the top. You can filter log streams by namespaces, applications, and ProcIDs. You can also filter them by custom time ranges.&#x20;

You can also click into a specific application or ProcID to view logs in more detail and to search through or identify patterns within your log data.&#x20;
