# Overview

Distributed tracing is a technique used to profile and debug distributed systems. A distributed system is a system where components are distributed across multiple machines. Distributed tracing allows you to trace the flow of a request as it goes through the different components of a distributed system. OpenTelemetry and Jaeger are two of the most popular distributed tracing tools.

### OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is an open-source project that provides a set of APIs and SDKs for instrumenting applications.

A few key points about OpenTelemetry:

* OpenTelemetry is designed to be vendor-neutral
* It offers APIs and SDKs for multiple languages
* It has an active community of contributors

### Jaeger

Jaeger is another open-source distributed tracing system..

A few key points about Jaeger:

* Jaeger was created by Uber
* It is written in Go
* It uses a distributed tracing model that is similar to Dapper

### Benefits

Distributed tracing can be used to find performance bottlenecks, debug errors, and understand the flow of a request through a distributed system.

Benefits of using distributed tracing technologies:

1. Find performance bottlenecks
2. Debug errors
3. Understand the flow of a request through a distributed system.

Using distributed tracing can help you to improve the performance of your distributed system and debug errors.
