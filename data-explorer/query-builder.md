# Query Builder

Once the user clicks on a metric, a promql query is created in the background and a widget is automatically added in the Tab area. \
Now by clicking on this widget user can make changes to the underlying query which is fetching data for that particular metric.

## Builder

User can tune this query by opening the query builder. The Query builder acts as a no code tool, user does not need to write the PromQL to fetch the data. They can just select fields for which they want the data to be included in the resulting dataset.
