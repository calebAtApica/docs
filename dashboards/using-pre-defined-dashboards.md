# Using Pre-defined Dashboards

## Overview

You can get more out of the monitoring dashboard when it monitors various aspects of your target. Building that kind of dashboard with more tricky queries can be time-consuming and delay you from knowing more about your application and infrastructure.

We help you to build a viable dashboard with a few clicks by providing you with pre-defined dashboards for some of the most common use cases.&#x20;

## Import Dashboard

* Expand the dashboards option from the navigation bar
* Click on the `Import dashboard`
* You will be navigated to the import dashboard page where you will be provided with some of the pre-defined dashboards
* Click the `import button` for the dashboard
* You will be displayed with a pop-up that will ask you for providing the dashboard name and datasource which will be used by the queries in the dashboard widgets
* After providing the inputs, click `Import`. You will be navigated to the dashboard page
